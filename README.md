# agents-best-practices

`agents-best-practices` is a general-purpose Codex skill for designing,
auditing, refactoring, and explaining agentic harnesses across domains.

It is not limited to coding agents. The same harness patterns apply to
research, support, operations, sales, finance, data analysis, procurement,
legal workflows, healthcare workflows, education, and other workflow agents.

The skill is provider-neutral and covers OpenAI, Anthropic, and
OpenAI-compatible API patterns.

## What Is Inside

The skill is organized around one entrypoint and a set of focused reference
files:

- `README.md` describes the skill for public repository visitors.
- `SKILL.md` defines when to use the skill, the core stance, the default answer
  structure, the reference map, and non-negotiable principles.
- `references/` contains deeper guides for architecture, loops, tools,
  permissions, context, memory, planning, goals, skills, connectors, security,
  evals, observability, provider APIs, and checklists.

Use `SKILL.md` first, then load only the reference files needed for the user's
specific harness design problem.

## Installation

Install the skill by cloning this repository into your Codex skills directory:

```sh
mkdir -p "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills"
git clone https://github.com/DenisSergeevitch/agents-best-practices.git \
  "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/agents-best-practices"
```

Restart Codex after installation so the skill index reloads.

To update an existing installation:

```sh
cd "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/agents-best-practices"
git pull --ff-only
```

## Table of Contents

1. **Agent Harness Architecture**

   How to design the runtime around a model: context, tools, permissions,
   memory, observability, and stopping conditions.

2. **Agentic Loop**

   The core loop: model call, tool call, validation, permission check,
   execution, observation, then the next step or final answer.

3. **System Prompts and Instructions**

   How to structure instruction layers: global, workspace, domain-specific,
   task-level, and runtime reminders.

4. **Tools and Permissions**

   How to design tools that are narrow, typed, safe, auditable, and separated
   by risk class.

5. **Planning Mode**

   How to separate planning from execution with read-only exploration, a plan
   artifact, approval, and only then mutations.

6. **Goal-Like Loop**

   How to define long-running goals with budgets, checkpoints, validation
   criteria, and a stop condition.

7. **Context, Memory, and Auto-Compaction**

   How to manage context, retrieval, working state, durable memory, and
   compaction without losing critical data.

8. **Prompt Caching and Cost-Aware Context**

   How to build stable prompt prefixes, deterministic tool ordering, and a
   cache-friendly agent runtime.

9. **Skills and Progressive Disclosure**

   How to attach reusable workflows: short skill indexes first, full
   instructions only when needed.

10. **MCP and External Connectors**

    How to connect external systems through governed connectors with
    namespacing, auth, permissions, audit logs, and least privilege.

11. **Security, Approvals, and Sandboxing**

    Prompt injection handling, secrets, approval flows, draft-versus-commit,
    and sandboxing for open-world tools.

12. **Observability and Evals**

    How to log agent runs, tool calls, approvals, compactions, failures, and
    test harnesses against real failure modes.

13. **Provider API Patterns**

    Practical implementation patterns for OpenAI, Anthropic, and
    OpenAI-compatible APIs without hard-coding the harness to one provider.

14. **Checklists and Coverage Audit**

    Ready-to-use checklists for launch readiness, tool additions, skills and
    connector integrations, and production review.

## When To Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user needs help with an agent, agentic workflow, AI
worker, autonomous assistant, or harness. It is especially useful when the task
involves tool design, permission boundaries, approval-gated execution, planning
mode, long-running goals, memory, compaction, skills, external connectors,
security, evals, observability, cost, or provider API choices.

Do not use it for ordinary one-shot writing, translation, or Q&A unless the
user is asking how to design an agent that will perform those tasks.

## Core Principle

An agent harness is the control plane around a model. The model proposes
actions; the harness validates, authorizes, executes, records, summarizes, and
returns observations. Keep the loop simple and make the runtime rigorous.
